I begin learning Portuguese, it is taught by my colleague. 
Becuase I have a lot of works everyday, the study will be a very long process.
Whatever, I like to learn new things `:)`.

I choose the book Portuguese for dummies as my learning material. 
One of the interesting thing is that my colleague said he find that some pronunciation rules in the book he has been using everyday but has never been realized.

I learned a little bit of [Diphthongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_orthography#Diphthongs) pronunciation in Protuguese.

Portuguese nouns come in two types: masculine and feminine. Masculine nouns usually end in an `-o`, and feminine nouns usually end in an `-a`.
