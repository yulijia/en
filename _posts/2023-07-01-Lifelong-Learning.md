I have initiated a category dedicated to discussing the valuable insights gained from my supervisors, and peers, and sharing personal reflections/thoughts. This category aims to share thoughts on the ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons.

In this initial post, I will continuously update and share insightful quotes from various individuals.

J: You are using only two numbers to determine your life.
*confusion matrix isn't enough, let's use AUC.*

T: If this decision is hard to make, that means this decision does not matter.
If this decision does not matter, then you can decide by tossing a coin.

> “Must a name mean something?” Alice asks Humpty Dumpty, only to get this answer: “When I use a word… it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.”
This reminds me of a famous statement from the 1960s: [The medium is the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelong_learning). Here you seem to be letting Google docs or Google form/spreadsheet determine how to organise your thoughts. That doesn’t seem to me to be the right way around.
