This is a beginer guide to learn ggplot2 with excercises. 

Since I use R for six years, I thought maybe it is the time to write some simple guide about R plotting for other new users.
So I write the first word about **learn ggplot2 the hard way** on January 21 2016, but just let it lying in my draft folder for about six months. 

To be honest, it is easy to plotting with `ggplot2` package than using the basic `graphics` package. 
For me, `graphics` is a powerful tools to create figures in R, and `ggplot2` is a fast tool to visualize data.
It is difficult to say which package is the best. There are also some discussion about it, for example [Comparing ggplot2 and R Base Graphics](https://flowingdata.com/2016/03/22/comparing-ggplot2-and-r-base-graphics/) and [Why I donâ€™t use ggplot2](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/).

Last month (May 2016), I wrote a simple guide about R plotting [in Chinese](http://yulijia.net/cn/%E5%8F%AF%E8%A7%86%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF/2016/05/18/simple-graphs-with-R.html).
I found my old project about learn ggplot2 the hard way is all most can not finished. Actually,  a 'learn X the hard way' style book doesn't work well for me to learn any code.
So I rename *learn ggplot2 the hard way* to *learn ggplot2 in practice*. I would also open a new project about plot the same figure using ggplot2 and R base graphics (it is the English version of my R plotting simple guide). Hope I can finish one of them in this month (June 2016).

That's all. Thanks for reading.
