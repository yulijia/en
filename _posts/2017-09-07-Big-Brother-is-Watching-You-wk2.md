We finished the Part I chapter 1 in 10 days! However, we have a lot of new words when reading the book.

In total, the book has 24 chapters, it will cost 240 workdays to finish reading (usually we have 260 workdays per year).

I need use quizlet to take note.

By the meantime, I create a list of similar words with different pronunciation that make me confused, [https://quizlet.com/_3oyluy](https://quizlet.com/_3oyluy). I will keep update it.
