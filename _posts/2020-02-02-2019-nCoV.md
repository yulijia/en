My friend in US ask me if there are lots of people are deaing in China recently.

From what I know many people outside China are scared by the fake news or some conspiracy theories. [As The Coronavirus Spreads, So Does Racism.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahkim/2020/01/30/coronavirus-racism-asian-communities/)

First of all, there are around 304 people deaths by date. In the early January some people died due to this disease, but the numbers are not count on the report because they didn't get a correct diagnosis.

The local government made action too late to stop the spread of the disease at the earlier stage. All Chinese feel angry with them. I believe some governer will go to jail after the end of the epidemic.
