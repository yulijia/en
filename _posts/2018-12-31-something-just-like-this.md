I've been reading books of old

The legends and the myths

Achilles and his gold

Hercules and his gifts

Spiderman's control

And Batman with his fists

And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

*But he said*, where'd you wanna go?

How much you wanna risk?

I'm not looking for somebody

With some superhuman gifts

Some superhero

Some fairytale bliss

Just something I can turn to

Somebody I can hug

I want something just like this

*I want to you be healthy, stay with me for another 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years...*

I've been reading books of old

The legends and the myths

The testaments they told

The moon and its eclipse

And Superman unrolls

A suit before he lifts

*But I'm not the kind of person that it fits*

*She said*, where'd you wanna go?

How much you wanna risk?

I'm not looking for somebody

With some superhuman gifts

Some superhero

Some fairytale bliss

Just something I can turn to

Somebody I can hug

I want something just like this

*I want to you be healthy, stay with me for another 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years...*
