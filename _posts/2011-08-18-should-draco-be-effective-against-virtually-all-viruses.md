A big news from MIT: [MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers develop a technique to cure a broad range of viruses](http://www.ll.mit.edu/news/DRACO.html "MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers develop a technique to cure a broad range of viruses")

>Dr. Todd Rider and his team have developed and demonstrated a novel broad-spectrum antiviral approach, called DRACO (for <span style="text-decoration:underline">D</span>ouble-stranded <span style="text-decoration:underline">R</span>NA <q>dsRNA</q> <span style="text-decoration:underline">A</span>ctivated <span style="text-decoration:underline">C</span>aspase <span style="text-decoration:underline">O</span>ligomerizer). DRACO selectively induces apoptosis, or cell suicide, in cells containing any viral dsRNA, rapidly killing infected cells without harming uninfected cells. As a result, DRACO should be effective against virtually all viruses, rapidly terminating a viral infection while minimizing the impact on the patient.

BUT, Should DRACO be effective against virtually all viruses?

I think there are many problem. **First**, DRACO can only senses double-stranded RNA, and DRACO just senses **long** ( &gt;~23nt ) dsRNA, so it just can senses a limit of viruses. **Second**, DRACO is a chimeric protein, how to delivery it into our body without proteolysis? The delivery mechanism may a big problem. **Third**, viruses have some tricks use to inhibit apoptosis. So, DRACOs seems not effective against virually all viruses.

BTW: Is Dr. Todd a fan of Harry Potter ? `;)`
