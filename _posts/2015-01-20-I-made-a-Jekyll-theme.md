**This article is  definitely a advertisement :p**

Last year, I made two Jekyll themes, one is [Freshman](http://yulijia.net/freshman/), the other is [Freshman21](http://yulijia.net/freshman21/). Freshman is a simple html/css theme that I made to learn Jekyll and css. Freshman21 looks like WordPress theme. A tribute to Twenty Twelve and Twenty eleven. I send a pull request to [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/), thanks to Matt Harzewski, my theme is already updated to the website in January.

If you are a fan of WordPress theme and try using Jekyll to build your own blog, may the Freshman21 be with you.

Freshman21 has two version: one-colunm and two-columns.

Welcome to submit new request to the [theme at github](https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21).
