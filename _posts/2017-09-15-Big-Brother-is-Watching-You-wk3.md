On this Friday, we begin read chapter 4. In this book, George Orwell use some (dialectal) British words or spellings, for example [fro](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fro), [connexion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connexion). I probably can guess the meaning. 

I also found there are a lot of cognates between Portuguese and English. That's the reason, my colleague has a large vocabulary than mine, `lol`.
