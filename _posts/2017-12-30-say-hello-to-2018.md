The new year will coming in few hours. 2018 will become very important year for me. I became more mature and responsible in the end of 2017. In 2018, I need to decide if I could move to some place to continue my research career or give up it, and find another kind of job (to become a programmer or data scientist again). 


I want to focus on few of research fields and study deeply. My personal goal for the coming year is to finish all my previous unfinished personal projects, such as [write learn R plot guide](http://yulijia.net/en/r-language/2016/01/21/Learn-ggplot2-the-hard-way-or-in-practice.html), learn more about javascript, write some thing about statistical test (I feel some of my scientist friends don't know why and how to do hypothesis test). I will keep writing posts on my English blog. 

In 2017, my colleague and I didn't finish reading 1984, I also didn't have enough time to learn Portuguese, I feel my English speaking and grammar even worse than before <code>lol</code>... But all these things will be better in the coming new year.
