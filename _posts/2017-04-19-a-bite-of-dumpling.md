I am in U.S. several months ago, working in a small south city. There are two big Asian markets in the city. Because I don't have vehicle, I have been to the Asian market no more than 8 times.

Almost everytime I went to the Asian market, I brough some frozen dumplings, kept them in my fridge, it is the best `Emergency Food` for me (thought it is not traditional Emergency Food).

I try to find what is the best dumplings in the markets, here is my report of some dumpling brands.
