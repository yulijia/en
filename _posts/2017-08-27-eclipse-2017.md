Eclipse 2017 has gone for 1 week ago. On my current living place, I can see Partial Solar Eclipses, actually I am not very interested in solar eclipses, when the maximum eclipse happened, that was my lunch time `;)`. I worked regularly on that day and decided do not to see eclipse. 

But I want to share the Ted talk [You owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_baron_you_owe_it_to_yourself_to_experience_a_total_solar_eclipse/). The most best part of the talk is that the author think 'duration of experience does not equal impact. One weekend, one conversation -- hell, one glance -- can change everything. <u>Cherish those moments of deep connection with other people</u>, with the natural world, and make them a priority.' For other part, his main idea is about respect nature.

Another interesting part of this eclipse is that I relearned [Pinhole camera](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/).
