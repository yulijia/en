The first day of 2019 (Yes, we go to hospital at 1st Jan 2019) starts with sent my family member to the hospital to do the biopsy, the last day of 2019 starts with told my family member to do the routing injection of Goserelin. I withdrew my Ph.D. offer in January and found a job near the hospital to take care of my family in my way. The main duty of my job is performing *In silico* proficiency testing program in China mainland.

it's been a difficult year for me and my family, I didn't write a lot this year. Maybe, I would make some treatment data public to seek suggestions from the internet later. 

I wish we still have a lot of time to share together.
